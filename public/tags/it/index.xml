      <description>A while ago, I learned that for some time building contractorâ€™s were using ethernet cables to build the telephony network running inside homes. Since RJ11(telephone jack) requires only two copper wires to function, the contractor uses ethernet cables(which have either 6 or 8 copper wires) to build up the telephony network, connects only 2 of those 6 or 8 wires and leaves out the rest hanging. The reasoning behind this: well easy, not much of a price difference between regular telephony networking cable and ethernet cable.</description>
