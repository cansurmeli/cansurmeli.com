      <description>I most definitely enjoy eating! Especially, a good breakfast. Nothing holds the place of some delicious food with some coffee in the morning.
As a sportsman, I&amp;rsquo;ve to eat healthy in order to properly fuel my body. Therefore things like a piece or two of bread with some jam on top or a croissant are out of the picture for me. Besides, I&amp;rsquo;ve been eating healthy for a very long time and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to taste such food anyway.</description>
