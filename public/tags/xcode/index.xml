      <description>Apple has some nice little features for the simulator in Xcode to boost your productivity or improve your environment. However, unfortunately, even if they&amp;rsquo;re currently fully functional, they&amp;rsquo;re hidden away. And knowing Apple, they&amp;rsquo;ll most probably keep it that way.
Although, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean these features were meant to stay hidden. You can enable them yourself. It used to be that only a single Terminal command of sudo mkdir /AppleInternal would enable it but as it has been commented out to me, it seems that Apple put some safe guards against this command.</description>
