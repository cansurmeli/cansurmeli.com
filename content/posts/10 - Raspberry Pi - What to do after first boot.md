When you boot into your Raspberry Pi for the first time, itâ€™s ready to do wonders! But before you do so, you can/should do some adjustments to better manage it.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve setup many `Pi`s and here are the things I perform when I first boot into one.

**Before we get started:**

- I'm a CLI person so all of the above will be about working via the SSH,
- for the sake of clarity, I've diluted some stuff. Therefore you need some prior knowledge on how to work with the CLI,
- the below are fairly common *nix commands, however, you should keep in mind that I assume you've installed Raspbian,
- some steps are not mandatory as mentioned below **BUT** they're much preferred as best practices. Especially if you've not a lot of experience working with *nix systems, I highly suggest them to get familiar with dealing with such systems. One day, you may have to deal with an instance somewhere on the cloud and it's better to start with training wheels(in this case, your Pi).

## [mandatory] Change the default password
That should be the very first thing you do when you first boot into your Pi.

Just type `passwd` and change your Piâ€™s default password to anything else other than `raspberry`.

`Pi`s are mostly installed in homes to do some hacking on the side so you might be the only one to tinker with it but as a good practice, just do it.

## [mandatory] Assign a static IP
Since youâ€™ll be remotely interacting with your Pi, itâ€™ll need a static IP. Otherwise you may have to fish it out every time your Pi boots or your network restarts.

To do so, I would like to point you to [this](http://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-a-static-ip-on-the-raspberry-pi/) good resource.

## [mandatory] Update the system
Before you go any further, update your Pi to keep it at itâ€™s best.

Even if youâ€™ve just downloaded Raspbian, it will have some outdated packages lying inside.

	$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get clean

## [optional] Install vim
This isnâ€™t mandatory but merely a suggestion.

Raspbian doesnâ€™t come with `vim` pre-installed which is the editor I prefer.

	$ sudo apt-get install vim

Also, from this point on, I will be explaining file edits via Vim. If you choose not do so, go with your preferred text editor.

## [optional] Create a custom user
I canâ€™t think of a mandatory technical reason for this one but in order to keep things neat and tidy, I prefer to create a new user account to work on the Pi.

To create a new user, simply execute the following command:

	$ sudo adduser [USERNAME]

If you would like to give that newly created user `sudo` privileges, follow the steps below. However, youâ€™ll be editing a system file with the system's default text editor, which is currently set to `nano`. If you prefer `vim` like I do, execute the following command beforehand:

	$ sudo update-alternatives --set editor /usr/bin/vim.tiny

On to giving `sudo` privileges to your newly created user:

- `$ sudo visudo`,
- find the line with the title commented out as ` # User privilege specification`,
- copy&paste the line underneath, the one: `root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`
- change the username in the new line to your newly created username.

And now take your newly created user's `sudo` privileges for a spin:

- type `su - [USERNAME]`  to switch to your newly created user,
- type `sudo ls /`
- enter your password,
	- **if** all goes well and your root directory gets listed, all is fine; carry on to next step,
	- **if not**, go back to your user `pi` and sort things out by carefully going over what's told above.

**Remark**

I would suggest you not to delete the user `pi` since some software makes use of it!

## [optional] Password-less login
It's more secure and convenient to login with public-key authentication.

First make sure that you're logged in as your newly created user. Afterwards:

    $ cd ~
    $ mkdir .ssh
    $ chmod 700 .ssh
    $ touch .ssh/authorized_keys
    $ chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys

Then on your local machine:

    $ cd ~/.ssh
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

Follow the on-screen instructions.

Once done, copy the contents of the newly created key's public part and paste it into the `authorized_keys` file on your Pi. For example, on macOS, to copy the contents:

    $ cat [KEY_NAME].pub | pbcopy

## [optional] Adjust your SSH defaults
Let's do some basic adjustments to how `sshd` functions. This will be a quick recap and if you want more detail on what relates to what, do search the web or checkout the resources down below.

First, open the file that holds the configuration for `sshd`:

    $ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Afterwards, change the following parameters in the file as suggested below:

		- AuthenticationMethods publickey
		- PubkeyAuthentication yes
		- PermitEmptyPasswords no
		- Port [YOUR_DESIRED_PORT NUMBER]
		- ClientAliveInterval 300
		- ClientAliveCountMax 0
		- Banner /etc/issue
		- IgnoreRhosts yes
		- HostbasedAuthentication no
    
Once you're done, have `sshd` acknowledge the changes by restarting it:

    $ sudo service ssh restart

**Remark**

About port number designations:

- 0 - 1023: well known ports assigned to common protocols. Therefore do not mess around with these,
- 1024 - 49151: registered ports assigned by ICANN to a specific service. Might be alright for internal use but who knows, it might still conflict with some software of yours,
- 49152 - 65535: dynamic and/or private ports. Ideal for custom ports designations.

## [optional] Install ZSH
Bash is a great shell, because of some of zsh's advantages, I prefer to work with zsh; e.g. much better auto-complete.

Hence, to install it and make it your default:

    $ apt-get install zsh
    $ chsh -s $(which zsh)

## [optional] Change it's hostname
If you (will)have multiple Pis on your network or just want to differentiate your single Pi's name, you should change it's hostname.

For the hostname, you can only use:

- uppercase/lowercase letters from `a` to `z`,
- digits from `0` to `9`,
- and the dash(`-`).

There are two files managing the hostname of your Pi. For the first one:

    $ sudo vim /etc/hostname

It should only contain a name, so change it to whatever you like.

For the second file(which is only there for some software):

    $ sudo vim /etc/hosts

Find the line starting with `127.0.0.1` and change the hostname to your preferred one.

## Ideas
Now that your Piâ€™s got the fundamentals, the world is yours! ðŸ˜œ

You can do a lot with a Pi but here are some everyday ideas to make it useful in your home environment:

- [Pi Hole](https://pi-hole.net) (network wide ad-blocking)
- [VNC Server](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-vnc-server/) (remote desktop)
- [Kodi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/kodi/) (media center running on Raspbian)
- [AirPlay Receiver](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-airplay-receiver/) (bring those old stereo equipment of yours to life without Apple's tax ðŸ˜‰)
- [iStat Server](https://bjango.com/istatserver/) (to monitor your Pi's stats)
- [NAS Server](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-nas/) (share a disk across your network)

**Remark**

For the purposes of turning your Pi into a media center, you've a few options out there other than Kodi; such as [OpenElec](https://openelec.tv)(formerly XMBC) or [OSMC](https://osmc.tv)(successor to Raspbmc). But those are **separate operating systems** built on top of other OSs. Meaning that if you choose one of them your Pi will serve merely as a media center and nothing else!

Personally, I prefer to go with the combination of Raspbian and Kodi since it allows me to do other things. Your preference may differ.

You can also go with the path of installing Raspbian on an SD card and OpenElec or OSMC on another and swap them out when needed, however, that's nowhere near convenient.

If you want some more information on turning a Pi hardware into a media center, [here](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/media-center-softwares-for-raspberry-pi/) is a good resource.
