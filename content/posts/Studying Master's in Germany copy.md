When I was in high school, the single major I wanted to study when I get to the university was computer engineering.

When I first started my bachelor's degree, I didn't had any plans to continue with a master's degree. It wasn't even a maybe but a probably no.

As I was finishing up my bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering I started more to get into the academic thinking. So my probably no started to slightly change.

When I was writing my thesis, I really took the time to make it fine.

1. Why Germany
First off, I'd like to state why I chose Germany. To state the facts:
- I didn't spend some time in Germany before,
- I don't have relatives living here,
- I learned some German back in high school and prior to high school but I forgot most of it since German isn't a language that can be used everyday like English, at least in my situation.

So in a way, Germany was a crazy shot for me.

2. Getting a visa
If you're living in a country that is part of the EU, you know what, just skip this part all together.

2. Coming to Germany
3. Finding an Accommodation
Let us come to the second crazy hard part of my story. This was hard, I mean really really really hard.

4. Surviving in Germany
