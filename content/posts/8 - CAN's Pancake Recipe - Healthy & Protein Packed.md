I most definitely enjoy eating! Especially, a fine breakfast. Nothing holds the place of some delicious food along with some coffee in the morning.

As a sportsman, I've to eat healthy in order to properly fuel my body. Therefore things like a piece or two of bread with some jam on top or a croissant are out of the picture for me. Besides, I've been eating healthy for a very long time that I don't want to taste such food anyway.

I'm quite fine with scrambling/boiling eggs or eating a bit of oat with a mixture of a banana and some milk but let's get a bit more creative, shall we!

Below is a pancake recipe that I've constructed myself. Yes, you've read it right. It's a pancake recipe but without any junk in it; yet super delicious and at the same time, protein packed!

# Ingredients
- 1 banana (medium or large sized)
- 4 eggs
- cinnamon (couple of pinches, mostly depends on your taste actually)
- 30 ml of maple syrup
- 1 regular coffee mug of oats
- 2/3 coffee mugs of milk

# Recipe
1. preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celcius
2. throw in the ingredients into your mixer
	- in order to keep things tidy, put the ingredients into the mixer in the given order above,
3. mix it,
	- as a nitty gritty detail, the time spent with mixing is also important and depends on your flavour of oat; more on that later,
4. place a baking paper onto your oven tray,
5. pour the mixed liquid onto the baking paper,
6. place the tray into your *preheated* oven for 25 minutes.

**remark:** Since I don't prefer to use any supplements, the recipe doesn't have anything of sort in it. It's up to you if you want to add some whey protein in it but I prefer one without it. Besides, there is still a lot of protein in it anyway.

# The Oat

Oat is a major player in the cuisine of the fitness industry. Hence forth, it is important in this recipe as well. There are a few things that are worth exploring about it they require their own section. And just to be clear, these are merely nitty gritty details. But still important!

The first is the kind of oat you're using. If you're using plain oat flakes, that's fine. However, in order to spice things up a bit more, you can throw in some nuts into your oat or buy an oat with them already in it. When the nuts gets mixed in, they'll not be fully crushed but will stay in pieces and it's another joy to taste it while eating.

Another point is the amount of time you spend with mixing. If you're making use of just oat flakes, I've come to realise that only 15 seconds or so is enough. Because if you mix it more than that, then the liquid loses it's ruggedness and the end result after baking isn't that satisfactory. However, if you have an oat with nuts or additional stuff(e.g. full grain oat mix) in it, 40 seconds of mixing should be your preferred choice.

# Take It On the Go
The great thing about this recipe is that you can take it along with you once it's cooled down. Either as a snack to fill in for that later hunger strike or as a full blown meal when you're short on time.

**tip:** If you're short on time in the morning, just cook it in the night, have it cool down and let it be ready in the morning. It's way tastier if it's fresh out of the oven, but better than none at the least.

# Drink It As a Shake
If you want to change the delivery of this most delicious food, you can also have it as shake.

Just remove the eggs from the above recipe because, you know, eggs are a bit distasteful when they're not cooked, and drink it as a shake; as your breakfast, post-workout shake or snack.

Enjoy and stay healthy!
