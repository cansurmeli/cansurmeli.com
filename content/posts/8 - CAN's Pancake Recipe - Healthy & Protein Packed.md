I most definitely enjoy eating! Especially, a good breakfast. Nothing holds the place of some delicious food with some coffee in the morning.

As a sportsman, I've to eat healthy in order to properly fuel my body. Therefore things like a piece or two of bread with some jam on top or a croissant are out of the picture for me. Besides, I've been eating healthy for a very long time and I don't want to taste such food anyway.

I'm quite fine with scrambling/boiling eggs or eating a bit of oat with a mixture of a banana and some milk but let's get a bit more creative, shall we!

Below is a pancake recipe that I've constructed myself. Yes, you've read it right. It's a pancake recipe but without any junk in it; yet super delicious.

# Ingredients
- a medium to large sized banana
- 4 eggs
- couple of pinches of cinnamon
- 30 ml maple syrup
- one coffee mug of oats
- 2/3 coffee mugs of milk

# Recipe
1. preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celcius
2. throw in the ingredients(in order to keep things tidy, put the ingredients into the mixer in the above given order),
3. mix it for 40 seconds,
4. put it into your oven for 25 minutes.

**remark:** Since I don't prefer to use any supplements, it doesn't have anything of sort in it. It's up to you if you want to add some whey protein in it but I prefer one without it. Besides, there is still a lot of protein in it anyway.

# Take It On the Go
The great thing about this recipe is that you can take it along with you once it's cooled down. Either as a snack to fill in for that later hunger strike or as a full blown meal when you're short on time.

**tip:** If you're short on time in the morning, just cook it in the night, have it cool down and let it be ready in the morning. It's way tastier if it's fresh out of the oven, but better than none at the least.

# Drink It As a Shake
If you want to change the delivery of this most delicious food, you can also have it as shake.

Just remove the eggs from the above recipe because, you know, eggs are a bit problematic when they're not cooked, and drink it as a shake; when you're having your breakfast or post-workout.
