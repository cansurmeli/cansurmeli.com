# My thoughts on the USB-C MacBook Pro design
I'm the owner of a 2017 model 15-inch MBP. There is a lot of controversy around this design and as a user of one, I'd like to point out my experience.

## Overall
I think this design is a great on in general. It's sleek

## TouchBar
People are too quick to judge. 

## Keyboard
There are two main subjects about this keyboard. First, the feel of it. And second, it's technical incapability.



## Connectivity
And on to connectivity which is a vital point for pro users.

I'm in the wagon of abandoning the old USB standard, USB-A. Everyone knows that technology moves forward but no one wants to drive it further. Well, if we don't embrace new standards, the old ones will stick with us and make our lives miserable. Yeah, it's a bit annoying at the moment to plug-in your USB sticks with adapters but it's all for a better future.

With that being said, I can make my cases for picking on Apple as in why they're wrong about removing the sdcard slot and the hdmi.
