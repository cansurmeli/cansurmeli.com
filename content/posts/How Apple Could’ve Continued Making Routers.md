Couple of years back, I really enjoyed it when I read that Apple is working on a new breed of AirPort devices with a lot more functionality to ease our lives. Therefore I was shocked to read later on that they ceased their AirPort development efforts.

I totally get that time changes and some products are need to let go but I fully think that letting AirPort go was an utterly wrong choice.

It's been some time that Apple has stated that they will cease developing their AirPort brand. And prior to that they also stated that they'll cease developing their custom made screens. Although they reversed this decision after experiencing how ASUS couldn't handle it as they could've. Unfortunately, there is no reverse decision about continuing AirPort development.

In my humble opinion, ceasing AirPort development is wrong! Once I saw a 9to5Mac article, stating a rumoured more advanced AirPort being in the works. But then it seems that Apple decided it wasn't worth the effort, trashed the project and navigated it's engineering power to other places. In fact, Apple might be right. I certainly don't know their internal discussions but let's imagine a future where AirPort was still being developed and got advanced.

But first...

# Why Apple Stopped AirPort Development
First off, let's take a look at why Apple ceased their AirPort development efforts.

Apple got into the networking business in such a time when other manufacturers were producing stuff which only tech-savvy people could operate. Actually, even tech-say people were struggling. I remember setting up my first ADSL connection. I couldn't.

Because the fast-setup functionality didn't actually function and the details page of the modem was a nightmare; especially for a young kid just starting to hack things around.

Back then, I wasn't using Apple hardware for my network. Wish I did but back then Apple wasn't present at my country.

Therefore it was such an opportunity for Apple to get into such a market and dominate.

# Come Back to Now
Now we got products like Eero,... What Apple dominated is also being produced by others as well. But that doesn't mean that it's enough. Apple has the power to do a lot more. Not just because they control both hardware and software but also they have a huge ecosystem and they've been creating their custom hardware for time now.

## Update Server
The thing about the global internet infrastructure is that it should be fast and agile. Everyone should've great speeds(both upload and download) at their disposal. Meaning not only their homes but also on the go. And this connection shouldn't suffer from time to time. Maybe not as fast as they should but things are going in this direction. Although this definitely doesn't mean that we should waste our resources.

Internet could be fast, and therefore you may download something fast but that doesn't mean if that is a reusable thing, it shouldn't be cached and used by someone else.

I'm talking about software updates and such. Nowadays, a household has more than one of a device. Couple of same model iPhones, a Mac or two. Why not store the latest software on AirPort and have the other devices reuse it.

Everyone benefits. Both Apple and the user doesn't waste their precious bandwidth and even though with a fast connection, it's certainly a lot faster to grab something locally than outside.

## iTunes Server
If one puts his/her iTunes Library into a Time Capsule, only Macs can share it. No iOS device or an Apple TV is able to use it.

I get the fact that Apple envisions a slightly different usage/future where content is not stored on the device but on the cloud. Although again for the reasons stated in the above section, it would be nice for any device, be it Apple TV, iPad or iPhone, be able to connect to the iTunes Library on the Time Capsule.

I hear some of you saying we've `Home Sharing` but it requires a computer broadcasting the library which creates a needless complexity to the system.

I also know that it would require changes in the iTunes Library format but in my humble opinion, it would certainly be worth the effort.

## Seamless Guest Connection
Whenever a guest comes to your house, it's a hassle to give them your network password. That is if you know it. Because there have been times where I had to find the modem and write down the password from the back of it.

Anyways, this hassle can be removed altogether. Have you seen the new feature in the BMW 7 series where you get to pair your phone with the car just by holding it to the centre console. The system makes use of NFC to easily pair your phone with the car to stream some music or whatever. (It kind of defeats the purpose for a 7 series which is generally used by elder people but not by young people who would make the most of this feature via their friends BUT 7 series is the flagship in terms of BMW's tech)

The same approach could be applied to AirPort. It would certainly be a lot easier to get your guests near to your AirPort router.

### Custom Hardware
Look at how AirPods makes use of the custom chip inside. This is the future. Apple always worked towards creating it's own hardware and currently it's a lot more important than ever to provide your customers with greater integration between hardware and software.

If Apple were to put it's own custom produced hardware into an AirPort or a Time Capsule, then the users of it would definitely see advancements: be it less signal interference, easier connectivity or etc.

## Conclusion
I now this is a lot of work. Work that may not even be completed in a years time. But imagine it being done. How much more intriguing the Apple ecosystem becomes.
