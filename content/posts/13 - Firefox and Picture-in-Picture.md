PIP, not the package installer for Python that I have a love/hate relationship :] but the picture-in-picture mode, is a considerable feature that allows you to efficiently make use of your screen.

It's great to have a video on the corner while doing some light work. Sure, you can also split the screen but that's not always the best option for getting the most out of your screen real estate.

## The Problem

The good thing about Apple is that they implement these features first out of the gate so if you stick with them, you get to enjoy these features first.

Which until recently was the case for me since I am/still a macOS user but not a Safari user due to the fact that I'm now considering that Safari, even though quite performant(which I have a lot of respect to it's engineers for this reason), is under-developed.

Safari's got a nice interface but it could definitely have more features. I'm not talking about anything major but minor features that makes a power-user's life easier.

And more importantly, lately, Apple seems to be dismissing software quality that minor bugs keep occurring and pissing the hell out of a power-user like me. 

Anyways, hence, I switched to Firefox(I despise Chrome's lack of care for performance and don't want to give Google more information) and now I'm happier while browsing the web.

However, I lost the feature of PIP which sucks. My current options of having a workaround are:

- wait for Mozilla to implement it > waste of time/energy and not exactly a workaround anyways :],
- use Firefox Nightly > I don't want to give away my stable browser,
- make use of IINA > perfect!

## Enter IINA

IINA is a new video player on the block. Open-source and written with Swift by the way! It combines Apple's design language with VLC's capabilities(haven't made a full comparison but it's a lot more capable than QuickTime Player).

Until now, I had to use two video players at once but with IINA, I can just stick to it because it's both as capable as VLC and as good looking as QuickTime Player.

## Firefox & IINA

There is a little [add-on of Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-in-iina-x/) for IINA that enables you to open the currently playing video stream in Firefox in IINA. Once there, you can use IINA's PIP feature to have the video playing on your corner. Hey, problem solved!

It's a bit more time consuming than Safari's direct integration but if you're not using Safari and you don't want unstable software, this is the best workaround there is. At least what I could find out.

## The Future

In the end, Firefox will get its PIP feature developed in a few months.

However, I think the `Open in IINA` will then again have its moment because IINA provides a much more capable video player. Sure, once in PIP, there aren't many features to use but if you change your mind while you're watching the video in PIP and get back to IINA's player, you have much more feature there, ready at your disposal, from the point in time you're left  in the video.
