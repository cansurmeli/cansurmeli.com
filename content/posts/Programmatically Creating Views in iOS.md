It's sort of like the tab or space dilemma of iOS world, to programmatically create views or not. So, here are my two cents on it.

## When Storyboards
If one thinks in terms of pure development tool quality, Interface Builder and Storyboards are phenomenal. I know that from time to time, those may just cause you to pull your hair out but just think of all the things they let you accomplish.

Therefore, if you want to work on your Xcode project with your designers, you definitely can.

## Your Game Plan
Now that you've peaked inside the story of Storyboards vs. UI Coding, it's time to decide on what you're going to do.

If you're fine in the land of Storyboards, then it's all settled. Keep on using them. Happy ending for you.

If you want to code your UI, then you may need to first try Storyboards. Because you need to experience the shortcomings of Storyboards so that you'll get a keen grasp on UI coding advantages. Otherwise, in due time, you may feel exhausted. Coding your UI will require you to know the nitty gritty details of iOS UI elements along with things like view lifecycle. When things get hard, imagining things programmatically will be hard. You'll need some reason to get you going.

## All In All
I do my very best to stay subjective. I'm not saying Storyboards are doomed. As with every technology out there, they've advantages and disadvantages.
