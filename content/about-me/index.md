Hi, I'm Can.

> (It's pronounced as `John` as in when you're talking in English with an American accent; so, if one day we come face to face, it's quite alright to address me as John. üòè)

Anyways, I'm a computer engineer from Istanbul, Turkey. Currently I'm wrestling with my master's degree in Informatik(the German way of saying Computer Science) at Universit√§t Passau in Passau, Germany.

My area of focus is intelligent technical systems and I mainly play in Apple's ecosystem via Swift; mostly iOS but recently some macOS and server-side as well.

Besides Apple, I'm a huge fan of CentOS and therefore run/manage almost all of my infrastructure needs on a CentOS instance.

Plus I'd like to tinker with Raspberry Pis on the side.

I'm kind of fading away from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cansurmeli/) due to too much noise going around so the best way to reach me is via [e-mail](mailto:c_surmeli@icloud.com).

You can check my code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/cansurmeli/), see my discussions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1169053/can) or view my photography at [500px](https://500px.com/c_surmeli).
