Hi, I'm Can.

> By the way, my name is pronounced as `John` as in when you're talking in English with an American accent; so, if one day we come face to face, it's quite alright to address me as John. üòè

Anyways, I'm a computer engineer born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. I've completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science in [Yeditepe University](https://yeditepe.edu.tr/). Currently, I'm about to put an end to my master's degree in Informatik(the German way of saying Computer Science) at [Universit√§t Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de/) in Passau, Germany.

### CS Interests

At the moment, I'm quite intrigued about the deep learning revolution and autonomous driving. Hence, I'm writing a thesis on that subject. Soon to be finished! ü§ûüèª

Besides those, I'm a developer deep into the *nix mindset and one who prefers Vim. However, I can also get up and running an iOS app from the ground up.

On the side, I'm learning more and more about developing a backend with Go. I'm quite familiar with managing a Linux box and maintaining a service with Docker. Therefore, it will be a nice addition to my abilities once I'm better at writing a backend.

Plus, from time to time, I tinker with a Raspberry Pi.

### Outside Interests

Besides computers, I'm a sports enthusiast. My main areas of interest are fitness and road cycling. I also used to do Judo but Covid-19 pandemic put that in hold unfortunately. Plus, I enjoy bouldering/climbing, running, and hiking long distances.

I really enjoy learning new things and podcasts combined with audiobooks really help in that regard. I used to follow a lot of podcasts but as time went by, I've realised that it's hard to manage. So, right now I follow what's below:

- [Another Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/another-podcast/id1535359773)
- [Huberman Lab](https://hubermanlab.com/welcome-to-the-huberman-lab-podcast/)
- [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/)
- [Philosophy Bites](https://philosophybites.com/)

> One small tip. Get used to listening in 1.5x or even 2x. Sometimes, listening in a slow pace decreases your learning efficiency. Plus, who has the time. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Get In Touch

I don't have any social media accounts except for [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cansurmeli/). Although, I've faded away from that as well due to too much noise going around. Trust me, it really clears your mind. However, I'm still keeping the account online as an online business card since I've a nice user handle. Plus, it's really easy to get in touch with fellow developers or companies.

Therefore, the best way to reach me is via old-school [e-mail](mailto:cansurmeli@outlook.com).
