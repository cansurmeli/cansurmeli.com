Hi, I'm Can.

(It's pronounced as John as in when you're talking with an American accent; so, if one day we come face to face, it's quite alright to address me as John. üòè)

Anyways, I'm a computer engineer doing my master's in Informatik (German way of saying Computer Science)in Passau, Germany.

My area of focus is intelligent technical systems and I mainly play in Apple's ecosystem; mostly iOS but recently some macOS and server-side as well. Besides Apple, I'm a huge fan of CentOS and therefore run/manage almost all of my infrastructure needs and I'd like to play with Raspberry Pi's on the side.
