Hi, I'm Can.

It's pronounced as John as in when you're talking with an American accent so if one day we came face to face, it's quite alright to address me as John. 😏

I'm a computer engineer doing my master's in Informatik in Germany. My area of focus is intelligent technical systems and I play in Apple's ecosystem; mainly iOS.
