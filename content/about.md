Hi, I'm Can.

> (It's pronounced as `John` as in when you're talking with an American accent; so, if one day we come face to face, it's quite alright to address me as John. 😏)

Anyways, I'm a computer engineer from Istanbul, Turkey. Currently I'm wrestling with my master's degree in Informatik(the German way of saying Computer Science) in Passau, Germany.

My area of focus is intelligent technical systems and I mainly play in Apple's ecosystem via Swift; mostly iOS but recently some macOS and server-side as well.

Besides Apple, I'm a huge fan of CentOS and therefore run/manage almost all of my infrastructure needs on a CentOS instance.

Plus I'd like to tinker with Raspberry Pi's on the side.

I'm kind of fading away from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cansurmeli/) so the best way to reach me is via [e-mail](mailto:c_surmeli@icloud.com).

You can check my code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/cansurmeli/) page, see my discussions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1169053/can) or view my photography on [here](https://500px.com/c_surmeli).
