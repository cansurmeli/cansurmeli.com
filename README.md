This is the source of my [personal web site & blog](https://www.cansurmeli.com) which is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## Installation
If you want to check out my web site or fork it to your own needs, you'll need to have Hugo installed on your system:

    $ brew install hugo

Once Hugo is installed, go to the root of my web site's directory and run `hugo server`.

Afterwards, you can access what's being locally broadcasted via `localhost:1313`.

You can find more about getting started with Hugo from [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

## Things I use
In every project I build, I prefer to depend on a minimum number of dependencies not because I want to invent the wheel every single time but because dependencies should be carefully managed otherwise they get out of control.

That being said, there are quite a lot of nice & handy stuff out there to make your life easier. Here are the ones I make use of in this web site of mine:

### Hugo
I believe Hugo is one of the best things that happened to the web. I sincerely respect the development teams of other CMS' out there, however, they're clunky & complicate things for no reason.

With [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)'s simple(simple doesn't mean basic!) approach, you not just get a fast but easy-to-manage system with the peace of mind given by an awesome CLI. From there on, you can also connect it to your CI/CD pipeline.

## Minimal
[Minimal](https://github.com/calintat/minimal/), is the theme my website is built upon which is developed by [Calin Tataru](https://github.com/calintat).

Since it's a simple theme, the visual structure is mostly the same with some modifications here and there but I've made a lot of changes under the hood. You can find my fork [here](https://github.com/cansurmeli/minimal).

### SASS
If you're writing pure CSS, you're making a huge mistake. That's it. Go use [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) now!

### Bootstrap
I like the way how [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) approaches the endeavour of providing you the fundamentals. We all need the same set of grid structure, typography, buttons, labels and etc.

Bootstrap gives all of these in a tight manner, without dirtying your project and you can continue building up from there.

### Fontawesome
And yeah, who doesn't need [icons](https://fontawesome.com).

### Zoom.js
It's nice to have [a good animation](https://github.com/fat/zoom.js/) for your pictures.
